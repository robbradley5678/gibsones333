      <p>The Gibson ES-333 was launched in 2003 as a more affordable verion of the ES-335.  Visually, it was stripped back, with a thin satin finish, a silkscreen headstock logo with no inlays, and no pickup covers or pickguard. Unlike the newer ES-335 studio model, it keeps the body and fingerboard binding.</p>

      <img class="responsiveImage" src="../images/es333.jpg" alt="Gibson ES-333">

      <p>Intead of the typical Classic 57 pickups, the ES-333 used the 490R and 498T in the neck and bridge positions. Gibson used these pickups in a lot of Les Paul models during this period. They have have a higher output than the 57's, giving the ES-333 a brighter and hotter tone when compared to a typical ES-335. It retains the standard 3-way selector switch and two-volume, two-tone controls.</p>

      <p>
      One interesting feature is the access pannel in the back of the body, compared to the solid rear of the ES-335. This was carried over from the ES-335 studio of the 1990s, and made repairs and modifications to the electronics much easier.</p>

      <p>At the time, stores were selling these guitars for hundreds of dollars, rather than thousands, and represented a great deal. The cream binding, thin finish and mint-green tuner heads gave the guitar the look and feel of a vintage instrument, and the Les Paul pickups really packed a punch.</p>

      <p>Sadly the ES-333 was discontinued in 2005, giving way to the ES-335 studio which was reissued in 2012. Despite their short production time, the ES-333 sold well, and used examples can be found fairly easily.</p>

      <p>In recent years their values have increased, but they are still more affordable then the ES-335, and still represent a bargain guitar.</p>

      <h2>Modifications</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>With the addition of a pickguard, nickel pickup covers and top-hat control knobs, the ES-333 can be to look like an ES-335. The cream binding, thin finish and green tuners lend themselves very well towards a vintage look. The satin finish can be polished with a fine cutting compound, and buffed to a mirror shine with an automotive wax.</p>

      <p>(Pro tip: using wax on the back of the neck eliminates the stickiness of the nitro finish. You'll have to reapply it fairly frequently though!)</p>

      <img src="../images/f36798afc3850ee3e33017e6d8602bd7.jpg" class="responsiveImage">

      <p>Check out this ES-333 next to a 1966 ES-335. Looks pretty good, doesn't it?</p>

      <p>The rear access pannel makes changing the pickups much easier. The 490 and 498's can be too hot for some player's tastes, and swapping to Classic 57's is a common modification. Using pure nickel strings can help tone them down a little.</p>

      <p>Other electronic modifications include adding a coil split, or even adding a full varitone circuit, Ã  la ES-345.</p>
